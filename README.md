# Cisco Projects
*Guides and Configurations for Cisco related Projects*


**Disclaimer:**
I am not an expert on any of these concepts. What I have done may not be conventional, but it is how I learnt the material. I will likely add more as I finish new projects. There are still some corrections, clarifications, and content I want to add to my papers, and I do not consider them 100% complete. Read at your own discretion.
